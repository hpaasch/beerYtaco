This web application is intended to enable a restaurant to create menu items, take
customer orders, fulfill kitchen and bar orders, tally a bill and mark a customer
as paid.

While everyone can see the index on the homepage of tacos, extras and drinks,
several links are visible only to Managers. Manager-only links are the blue buttons
to create a new taco, drink or extra, and the Update or Delete links for each taco.

With more time, these items would be high on the short list of additional functionality:
1. More securely limit access to Manager-only functions by setting up a permission
or limiting access to users who pass a test.
2. Create radio buttons for ordering.
3. Reduce the clicks needed to mark an Order Up.
4. Enable resetting a table to unpaid when new items are ordered.
5. Make the navbar tighter.
6. Add manager-only Update and Delete links to the Drinks and Extras.
